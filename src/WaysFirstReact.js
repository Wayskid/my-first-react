        <h1>This is Ways First React Project</h1>
        <p>I must confess, this all looks weird and I'm asking myself what the creator of React could be thinking when making this. 
            I like simple html and vanilla js just the way it is. 
            But then, they say react takes you to the next level. 
            It makes you become more skilled and very professional. 
            I think I agree to that so far: It looks very quiet complex 
            (but in an easy way considering I've learnt the basics of web dev well). 
            It looks more thorough and professional so far.
            I hope with time I will see the reason behind using React 
            and start enjoying it.
       </p>

       <p>PS. This all looks so ugly considering theres no css yet, I can't wait to learn that.</p>
    </div>
